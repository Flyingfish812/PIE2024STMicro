# Project: Supervised Learning for Evaluating Microelectronic Components Similarity

---

## Project Description

This is a group engineering project (projet d'ingénierie en équipe, PIE) of ENSTA 2024. This project focuses on applying supervised learning techniques to evaluate the similarity of microelectronic components based on their characteristics. The goal is to develop a system that compares two components and provides a similarity score. The project will start with basic machine learning models like regression and decision trees, progressing to neural networks and semi-supervised methods. An important aspect is fine-tuning the models on new datasets, with input from engineers at STMicroelectronics.

## Project Objectives

- Develop algorithms to evaluate the similarity between microelectronic components.
- Explore a range of machine learning models, starting from basic to advanced techniques.
- Implement a model specialization system for small datasets.
- Work closely with engineers to refine models based on feedback.

## Expected Deliverables

- A machine learning algorithm that outputs a similarity score for components.
- A refined methodology incorporating iterative feedback from engineers.
- A final report detailing methods, results, and conclusions.
