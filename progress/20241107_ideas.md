To determine the variance ( \sigma^2 ) such that 99% of the values of a normal distribution ( X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) ) lie within the interval ([0.93, 0.99]), follow these steps:

Define the Parameters:

Mean (( \mu )): [ \mu = 0.96 ]

Desired Interval: [ [0.93, 0.99] ] This implies: [ \mu - 0.03 = 0.93 \quad \text{and} \quad \mu + 0.03 = 0.99 ]

Determine the Z-Score for 99% Confidence:

For a normal distribution, approximately 99% of the data lies within ( z ) standard deviations from the mean. The z-score corresponding to 99% confidence is: [ z \approx 2.576 ]

Set Up the Equation:

The interval ([0.93, 0.99]) corresponds to: [ \mu \pm z \sigma = 0.96 \pm 0.03 ]

Therefore: [ 0.03 = z \sigma ]

Substituting the z-score: [ 0.03 = 2.576 \sigma ]

Solve for ( \sigma ):

[ \sigma = \frac{0.03}{2.576} \approx 0.01165 ]

Calculate the Variance ( \sigma^2 ):

[ \sigma^2 = (0.01165)^2 \approx 0.000135 ]

Summary:

Mean (( \mu )): 0.96
Standard Deviation (( \sigma )): Approximately 0.01165
Variance (( \sigma^2 )): Approximately 0.000135
